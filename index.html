        <p>
          As at 29 November 2021,
          <strong>155 people have been arrested</strong> on suspicion of
          breaching the national security law. Among them,
          <strong>100 were charged</strong> and four companies were also
          prosecuted for allegedly violating the security legislation.

      <h2>Third Jailing</h2>
      <h2>Arrest</h2>

      <h2>Leaving</h2>
      The New York Times suddenly revealed on July 14 it was to relocate its
      Hong Kong digital news team – equalling about a third of its staff – to
      Seoul, South Korea. It cited press freedom fears arising from the new
      legislation and unusual difficulties securing work permits, “rarely an
      issue” before.

      <h2>Top foreign judge resigns</h2>
      <p>
        An Australian judge resigned from a local top court in early September,
        citing unspecified reasons related to the security legislation. Justice
        James Spigelman – who has served as an overseas non-permanent judge in
        Hong Kong since 2013 – told Australian media his decision to step down
        from the Court of Final Appeal was “related to the content of the
        national security legislation,” but did not explain further.

      <h2>Group disband</h2>
      at least 50 civil society groups, including unions, churches and political
      parties, have decided to disband.

      <h3>National security tips</h3>

      The police announced they received over 200,000 tips, averaging around 550
      a day, via a dedicated hotline for national security crimes in its first
      year of operation.

      <h3>Press</h3>
      <h3>Censorship</h3>
      <h4>Books</h4>
      Days after the enactment of the law, at least nine pro-democracy titles
      disappeared from public library shelves, prompting fears over censorship.
      <a
        >https://hongkongfp.com/2020/07/04/democracy-books-disappear-from-hong-kong-libraries-including-title-by-activist-joshua-wong/</a

      <h4>Textbook</h4>

        >https://hongkongfp.com/2020/08/19/hong-kong-teachers-union-raises-concerns-over-censorship-as-publishers-revise-textbooks-after-govt-review/</a
      >
      Six publishers revised the content in eight sets of Liberal Studies
      textbooks following a voluntarily screening by the Education Bureau,
      prompting censure from the Hong Kong Professional Teachers’ Union, which
      accused publishers of censoring sections on civil disobedience objectives.
      <br />Local media reported the phrase “separation of powers” and an image
      of a “Lennon Wall” containing pro-democracy messages were removed, as well
      as a line reading: “Some political groups criticised the law enforcement
      methods by police in recent years for violating human rights and
      infringing upon Hong Kong residents’ freedom of assembly and protest.”
      Warnings about abiding by the law as a civic responsibility were also
      reportedly added to textbook chapters on civil disobedience.
      <h4>textbook</h4>
      ‘Patriotism’ textbooks for schools
      <a
        >https://hongkongfp.com/2021/03/23/hong-kong-will-distribute-mainland-books-to-schools-to-promote-patriotism/</a
      >
      <p>
        All Hong Kong primary, secondary and special schools will receive
        textbooks published by a state-owned mainland publisher called “My Home
        is in China” from the Education Bureau to promote patriotism among
        students.
      </p>

      <p>
        The bureau also sent a circular to the city’s schools with a list of 100
        books recommended to instil a sense of Chinese national identity. The
        supplementary textbooks come after education authorities issued
        guidelines for national security education to be implemented in the
        city’s primary and secondary school curriculum.
      </p>
      <h4>Film</h4>
      <p>
        Hong Kong passed a controversial law allowing censors to ban films seen
        as contrary to China’s national security
      </p>

      ></a>
      Two films were banned from a student film festival after Hong Kong’s film
      authority refused to grant approval. One of the two failed to receive
      approval after the director refused to cut scenes relating to Taiwanese
      President Tsai Ing-wen’s re-election in 2020, while the other student film
      tackled issues of “totalitarian rule, capitalism, freedom and resistance.”
      <h4>TV</h4>
      <h5>Disney+</h5>
      Meanwhile, the new streaming service Disney+ appeared to have made an
      episode of popular American cartoon The Simpsons unavailable on Hong Kong
      servers. The episode included references to the 1989 Tiananmen Massacre
      and ensuing Chinese censorship of news of the crackdown.

      ></a>
      <h4>website: Anti-government website blocked</h4>
      A pro-democracy website was blocked by at least one of the city’s major
      telecom providers following a police order, sparking fears of encroaching
      internet censorship in the name of national security. The site,
      HKChronicles, served as a doxxing platform against police officers and
      pro-Beijing figures and also collected information on the 2019 protests.

      <h2>Art</h2>
      <p>National security bureau can decide if art legal</p>
      <p>
        A photo piece by dissident Chinese artist Ai Weiwei will not be shown at
        Hong Kong’s new flagship contemporary art museum “M+”, which is set to
        open later this year. The government official in charge of the cultural
        park says the newly set-up national security bureau will decide which
        artworks and installations are in breach of the new laws, adding that he
        welcomed vetting from the unit.
      </p>
      <p>
        The move followed earlier comments by Chief Executive Carrie Lam that
        authorities will be on “full alert” for art displays that may endanger
        national security.
